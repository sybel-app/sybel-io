Creators are at the center of history. What remains of human history today is the result of the work of Creators. Who were the Creators behind the cave paintings, who were the architects of monuments, castles, bridges? How many famous painters have suffered a miserable life, how many authors have suffered the same fate?
## Our Vision

Our vision is to give Creators the rightful place they deserve in society. The value has to be to share equally between those who create, those who fund and those who consume content. By empowering all these people to govern and to be rewarded for the value they create, whether that be through work, investment or engagement, the Sybel ecosystem finds Web3 the perfect way to facilitate this outcome.

## Pushing decentralization even further

Pushing decentralization even further}
The core of the reactor of Sybel Web3 version is based on three pillars:


- An utility token $SYBL allows Creators and Users to be rewarded for their work and commitment. This reward is both economical and democratic
- A governance token  $SYE allows Creators and Users to vote for some decisions and can trade with others cryptocurrencies
- The possibility for Creators to mint NFTs (ERC 1155) from their work and financialize them, for example through fractionalizing the NFT into shares that users can buy  in exchange for future revenues and rights. Thus each user will be able to own a share of the Creator's work which will give them economic and democratic rights
